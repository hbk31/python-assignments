# # Q1

# Escape characters are special characters in a string that are used to represent certain actions or characters that cannot be easily typed or represented directly. They are indicated by a backslash () followed by a specific character. Escape characters allow you to include special characters, control characters, and other non-printable characters in your string.
# 
# Here are some commonly used escape characters in Python:
# 
# \n: Represents a newline character. It is used to start a new line.
# 
# \t: Represents a tab character. It is used to create horizontal spacing or indentation.
# 
# **': Represents a single quote character. It is used to include a single quote within a string delimited by single quotes.
# 
# ": Represents a double quote character. It is used to include a double quote within a string delimited by double quotes.
# 
# \: Represents a backslash character. It is used to include a backslash within a string.

# In[1]:


# Newline example
print("Hello\nWorld!")


# Tab example
print("Name:\tJohn")


# Single quote example
print('She said, \'Hello!\'')


# Double quote example
print("He said, \"Hi!\"")


# Backslash example
print("C:\\path\\to\\file")


# # Q2

# In Python, the escape characters \n and \t represent specific control characters:
# 
# \n stands for the newline character. When encountered in a string, it creates a new line or moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line.
# 
# \t stands for the tab character. When encountered in a string, it inserts a horizontal tab or creates a horizontal spacing equivalent to a tab stop.
# 
# Here's an example to illustrate the usage of \n and \t:

# In[2]:


print("First line\nSecond line")


print("Name:\tJohn")


# In the first example, the string "First line\nSecond line" contains the newline escape character \n. When printed, it creates a line break, resulting in the output displayed on two separate lines.
# 
# In the second example, the string "Name:\tJohn" contains the tab escape character \t. When printed, it inserts a horizontal tab, causing the output to have a tab-like indentation between "Name:" and "John".

# # Q3

# To include a backslash character (\) in a string, you can use the escape character \\. 
# This is because the backslash itself is an escape character in Python, so to represent a literal backslash, you need to escape it with another backslash.

# In[4]:


print("C:\\path\\to\\file")


# In the example above, the string "C:\\path\\to\\file" contains double backslashes (\\) to represent a literal backslash. When printed, the output displays a single backslash between each directory or file path segment.
# 
# 
# Alternatively, you can also use a raw string by prefixing the string literal with the letter 'r'. In a raw string, backslashes are treated as literal characters and do not act as escape characters. 

# In[18]:


print(r"C:\path\to\file")


# In this case, the r prefix before the string (r"C:\path\to\file") denotes a raw string, and the backslashes are treated as ordinary characters without any special meaning.

# # Q4

# In Python, you can use either single quotes ('') or double quotes ("") to delimit string literals. In the given string, "Howl's Moving Castle," single quotes are used to delimit the string. Since the string is enclosed in single quotes, the presence of a single quote character within the string itself (in the word "Howl's") does not pose a problem or require escaping.
# 
# 
# Python allows you to include a single quote character within a string delimited by single quotes without any issues. This is because the presence of single quotes within a string delimited by single quotes is automatically handled by the language. Similarly, you can include double quotes within a string delimited by double quotes without the need for escaping.

# In[7]:


print('Howl\'s Moving Castle')


# In the example above, the single quote in the word "Howl's" does not cause any issues because it is treated as a regular character within the string delimited by single quotes. 
# The backslash before the single quote (\') is not used for escaping but is only required if you want to include a literal single quote within a string delimited by single quotes.

# # Q5

# If you don't want to use the \n escape character to represent newlines in a string, you can achieve the same result using multi-line string literals or by concatenating multiple string literals.
# 
# 1.Multi-line string literals:
# You can create a string of newlines by enclosing your text within triple quotes (""" or '''). Each line break in the source code will be included as a newline character in the resulting string.

# In[8]:


text = """This is a string
with multiple
lines."""
print(text)
# Output:


# In the example above, the multi-line string literal spans across multiple lines, and the line breaks are preserved in the resulting string.

# 2.Concatenating string literals:
# You can concatenate multiple string literals, each representing a line of text, to create a string with newlines.

# In[10]:


line1 = "This is line 1."
line2 = "This is line 2."
line3 = "This is line 3."
text = line1 + "\n" + line2 + "\n" + line3
print(text)


# In this example, the string literals line1, line2, and line3 represent individual lines of text. The newline character (\n) is concatenated between each line to create the final string with newlines.
# 
# Both approaches allow you to create strings with multiple lines and achieve the effect of a string of newlines without using the \n escape character directly.

# # Q6

# The given expressions are string indexing and slicing operations on the string 'Hello, world!'. Here are the values of each expression:
# 
# 1. 'Hello, world!'[1]: The value of this expression is the character at index 1 in the string, which is 'e'.
# 
# 2. 'Hello, world!'[0:5]: This expression represents string slicing, which returns a substring starting from index 0 and ending at index 4 (5 is excluded). The value of this expression is 'Hello'.
# 
# 3. 'Hello, world!'[:5]: This expression is another form of string slicing where the start index is omitted, and it defaults to 0. It returns a substring from the beginning of the string until index 4 (5 is excluded). The value of this expression is also 'Hello'.
# 
# 4. 'Hello, world!'[3:]: This expression represents string slicing where the start index is 3, and the end index is omitted, which means it extends until the end of the string. It returns a substring starting from index 3 until the end. The value of this expression is 'lo, world!'.

# # Q7

# The values of the given expressions are as follows:
# 
# 1. `'Hello'.upper()`: The `upper()` method is called on the string `'Hello'`, which converts all characters in the string to uppercase. The value of this expression is the uppercase version of the string `'HELLO'`.
# 
# 2. `'Hello'.upper().isupper()`: In this expression, the `upper()` method is called on the string `'Hello'` to convert it to uppercase, resulting in `'HELLO'`. Then, the `isupper()` method is called on the uppercase string to check if all characters are uppercase. The value of this expression is `True` because all characters in the string `'HELLO'` are indeed uppercase.
# 
# 3. `'Hello'.upper().lower()`: Here, the `upper()` method is first called on the string `'Hello'`, resulting in `'HELLO'`. Then, the `lower()` method is called on the uppercase string to convert it back to lowercase. The value of this expression is the lowercase version of the string `'hello'`.
# 
# To summarize:
# - `'Hello'.upper()` evaluates to `'HELLO'`.
# - `'Hello'.upper().isupper()` evaluates to `True`.
# - `'Hello'.upper().lower()` evaluates to `'hello'`.

# # Q8

# The values of the given expressions are as follows:
# 
# 1. `'Remember, remember, the fifth of July.'.split()`: The `split()` method is called on the string `'Remember, remember, the fifth of July.'`. By default, the `split()` method splits the string into a list of substrings based on whitespace characters. Since no specific separator is provided, the string is split into substrings wherever there is whitespace. The value of this expression is the resulting list of substrings: `['Remember,', 'remember,', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'July.']`.
# 
# 2. `'-'.join('There can only one.'.split())`: In this expression, the `split()` method is called on the string `'There can only one.'` to split it into a list of substrings based on whitespace characters. The resulting list is `['There', 'can', 'only', 'one.']`. Then, the `join()` method is called on the string `'-'` using the list as an argument. The `join()` method concatenates the elements of the list using the specified separator, which is `'-'` in this case. The value of this expression is the resulting string after joining the list elements with `'-'`: `'There-can-only-one.'`.
# 
# To summarize:
# - `'Remember, remember, the fifth of July.'.split()` evaluates to `['Remember,', 'remember,', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'July.']`.
# - `'-'.join('There can only one.'.split())` evaluates to `'There-can-only-one.'`.

# # Q9

# In Python, you can use the following string methods to modify the alignment of a string:
# 
# 1.'ljust(width[, fillchar]): This method left-justifies a string by padding it with a specified fill character (default is a space) on the right side, resulting in a string with a specified width. The original string is aligned to the left, and the remaining space is filled with the fill character.

# In[12]:


text = "Hello"
width = 10
padded_text = text.ljust(width)
print(padded_text) 


# 2.'rjust(width[, fillchar]): This method right-justifies a string by padding it with a specified fill character (default is a space) on the left side, resulting in a string with a specified width. The original string is aligned to the right, and the remaining space is filled with the fill character.

# In[13]:


text = "Hello"
width = 10
padded_text = text.rjust(width)
print(padded_text)  


# 3.'center(width[, fillchar]): This method centers a string by padding it with a specified fill character (default is a space) on both sides, resulting in a string with a specified width. The original string is centered within the width, and the remaining space is filled with the fill character.

# In[14]:


text = "Hello"
width = 10
padded_text = text.center(width)
print(padded_text)  


# In all the examples above, the width parameter determines the final width of the resulting string after alignment. The fillchar parameter (optional) specifies the character to be used for padding. If not provided, it defaults to a space character.

# # Q10

# In Python, there are several ways to remove whitespace characters from the start or end of a string. Here are some commonly used approaches:
# 
# 1.'strip(): The strip() method removes whitespace characters from both the start and end of a string. It returns a new string with the leading and trailing whitespace removed.

# In[15]:


text = "   Hello   "
trimmed_text = text.strip()
print(trimmed_text)  


# 2.'lstrip(): The lstrip() method removes whitespace characters from the start (left) of a string. It returns a new string with the leading whitespace removed.
# 
# Example:

# In[16]:


text = "   Hello"
trimmed_text = text.lstrip()
print(trimmed_text)  


# 3.'rstrip(): The rstrip() method removes whitespace characters from the end (right) of a string. It returns a new string with the trailing whitespace removed.

# In[17]:


text = "Hello   "
trimmed_text = text.rstrip()
print(trimmed_text)  


# These methods are effective for removing leading and trailing whitespace characters from a string. Choose the appropriate method based on whether you want to remove whitespace from both ends (strip()), only the start (lstrip()), or only the end (rstrip()).
